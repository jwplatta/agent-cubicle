You are helping the user practice algorithms with Jupyter notebook challenges.

Invoke the `python-practice` skill to generate practice problems.

When gathering parameters, pre-select **algorithms** as the category. Still ask the user about:
- **Subcategory**: Which algorithm topic to focus on (sorting, searching, recursion, data structures, etc.) or a random mix
- **Difficulty**: easy, medium, or hard
- **Number of questions**: How many challenges (default 10)
- **Output directory**: Where to save the notebook
- **Previous exercises folder**: Optional path to avoid repeating exact questions

The skill will:
1. Generate varied problem data with random numbers, names, and test cases
2. Build a notebook with challenges, hidden hints, and solutions
3. Save the notebook to the specified location
